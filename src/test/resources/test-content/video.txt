Whether you know it or not, serious accusations are being made – against you.

Hmm.

The kingdom of God is legal.

God is the judge – Psalm 96:13

Jesus is our advocate – 1 John 2:1

Satan is the accuser – Revelation 12:10

There are a multitude of witnesses – Hebrews 12:1

Faith is evidence – Hebrews 11:1

All parties to the heavenly legal system are always present, except one – the evidence.

Evidence must be presented ‘for the prosecution’.

Satan accuses constantly – Revelation 12:10

For every accusation, we must present evidence – that is, faith.

Faith comes by hearing the word of God – Romans 10:17

Not ‘reading the word of God’.

But: ‘hearing the Word of God’.

You only hear what is spoken.

So speak the Word of God: ‘For the righteousness of faith speaks’ – Romans 10:6
