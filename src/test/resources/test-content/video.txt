Whether you know it or not, serious accusations are being leveled - against you.

Hmm.

The Kingdom of God is legal.

God is the judge - Psalm 96:13

Jesus is our advocate – 1 John 2:1

Satan is the accuser – Revelation 12:10

There is a multitude of witnesses – Hebrews 12:1

Faith is evidence – Hebrews 11:1 

All the parties to heaven’s legal system, are always present, but one – evidence.

Evidence needs to be provided on a “per accusation” basis.

Satan continually accuses – Revelation 12:10

For each accusation, we need to present evidence – that is: faith.

Faith comes by hearing the word of God – Romans 10:17

Not: “reading the word of God”. 

But: “hearing the word of God”.

You only hear that - which is spoken.

So, speak the word of God: “for the righteousness of faith speaks” – Romans 10:6
