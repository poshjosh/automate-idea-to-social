00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Whether you know it or not, serious accusations are being leveled - against you.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hmm.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The Kingdom of God is legal.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
God is the judge - Psalm 96:13

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Jesus is our advocate – 1 John 2:1

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Satan is the accuser – Revelation 12:10

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
There is a multitude of witnesses – Hebrews 12:1

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Faith is evidence – Hebrews 11:1 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
All the parties to heaven’s legal system, are always present, but one – evidence.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Evidence needs to be provided on a “per accusation” basis.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Satan continually accuses – Revelation 12:10

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
For each accusation, we need to present evidence – that is: faith.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Faith comes by hearing the word of God – Romans 10:17

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Not: “reading the word of God”. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
But: “hearing the word of God”.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You only hear that - which is spoken.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So, speak the word of God: “for the righteousness of faith speaks” – Romans 10:6
